# JMotor Library

## work in progress! Bug reports/fixes welcomed

reference docs (made with Doxygen): https://joshua-8.github.io/JMotor/md_readme.html

list of all classes: https://joshua-8.github.io/JMotor/hierarchy.html

*add description of library here* (copy to/from library.properties description)

supports the following boards:   ESP32, Arduino AVR (tested on nano), Teensy (tested on LC), SAMD M0 boards (tested on feather m0)

Why do all the classes start with J? It's to avoid name conflicts with other libraries (and J is my first initial).

This library uses lots of floating point math, and in general isn't optimized for speed or small size. Ease of use and ease of development is prioritized.
